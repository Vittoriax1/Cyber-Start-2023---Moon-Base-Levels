# CHALLENGE 1: Create an empty array called numbers.
numbers = []

# CHALLENGE 2: Write a while loop that will add 100 numbers to the
#              array, starting from the number 100 and incrementing by
#              2 each time. For example, start from 100, then the next
#              number added will be 102, then 104 and so on.
start_number = 100
while len(numbers)<100:
  numbers.append(start_number)
  start_number += 2

# CHALLENGE 3: Write a for loop that will look through your numbers
#              array and print out each value in the array.
for number in numbers:
  print(number)
