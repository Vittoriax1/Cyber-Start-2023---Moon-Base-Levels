# Write a script to generate a passphrase by taking words from

# The wordNumbers array holds three random numbers. Each number
# corresponds to a word in words.txt. So for example
# wordNumbers[1] is the second word in /tmp/words.txt.
# Put a space between each word and print it out
#


# Load the randomly generated word numbers from /tmp/randomwordsnumbers.txt
with open("/tmp/randomwordsnumbers.txt", "r") as file:

# Open the words file and read lines
with open("/tmp/words.txt", "r") as words_file:

# Extract words using the word numbers from wordNumbers and add them to the selected_words list
for word_number in wordNumbers:
    index = int(word_number)  # Convert the word number to an integer
    if 0 <= index < len(lines):
        word = lines[index].strip()  # Subtract 1 to account for 0-based indexing
        selected_words.append(word)

# Create the passphrase by joining the selected words with spaces
