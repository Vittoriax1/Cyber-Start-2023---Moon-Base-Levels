# CHALLENGE 1: Write a function that takes in two integers and
#              multiplies them together then returns the result.
def multiplyTwoInts(int1, int2):
  return int1 * int2


# CHALLENGE 2: Run the function from CHALLENGE 1, passing in the
#              integers 99 and 52 and print the result.
print(multiplyTwoInts(99, 52))

# CHALLENGE 3: Write a function that takes two integers and prints
#              the string "I am X ft Y inches tall", replacing the
#              X and Y with the numbers passed into the function.
def printTwoInts(int1, int2):
  return "I am " + str(int1) + " ft " + str(int2) + " inches tall"


# CHALLENGE 4: Run the function from CHALLENGE 3, passing in 6 and 2
#              as the parameters.

print(printTwoInts(6, 2))
# You should end up with 2 lines output from these 4 challenges.
