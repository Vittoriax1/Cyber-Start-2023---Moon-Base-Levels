# CHALLENGE 1: Write a TCP Client that will connect to 127.0.0.1 on
#              port 9990.
#              Your client must send "Knock, knock" to the server.
#              Then get the response, and print it out.
# Create a socket for the client
import socket

clientsocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Define the server address (IP and port)
server_address = ('127.0.0.1', 9990)

try:
    # Connect to the server
    clientsocket.connect(server_address)

    # Send the message "Knock, knock" to the server
    message = "Knock, knock"
    clientsocket.send(message.encode())

    # Receive and print the response from the server (up to 1024 bytes)
    response = clientsocket.recv(1024).decode()
    print("Server's response:", response)

except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)

finally:
    # Close the client socket
    clientsocket.close()
