# CHALLENGE 1: Write a for loop that will create a file called
#              /tmp/cars.txt. There should be 50 lines of text in the
#              file. The first line should be "There are 0 cars"
#              and 1 car should be added every line. Until
#              the last line which should read "There are 49 cars"
with open("/tmp/cars.txt", "a") as ch_file:
	for i in range(0,50):
		ch_file.write("There are " + str(i) + " cars\n")

# CHALLENGE 2: Open the file at /tmp/cars.txt and read the contents.
#              Print the contents to the screen.
with open("/tmp/cars.txt", "r") as myfile:
	print(myfile.read())
