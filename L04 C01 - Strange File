# Ok, quick task for you agent - we've received a strange file from
# the first alien communication.
# It's at /tmp/alien-signal.txt, we need you to open and read the file.

# Define the file path
file_path = "/tmp/alien-signal.txt"

# Open and read the file
with open(file_path, "r") as file:
	signal_contents = file.read()
  # Print the contents of the file
